## Abstract / Purpose
**Sanatana Samyata** is a comprehensive educational resource that combines:
- Scriptural and historical rebuttals to widespread misconceptions about Sanatan Dharma (caste, varna, temple entry, equality, social justice, etc.).
- Practical safety guidelines for women and children to identify manipulative and coercive tactics in relationships.
- Publicly available insights from ex-Muslims regarding alleged radical strategies for demographic change and conversions.
- Detailed red-flag checklists associated with reported coercive conversion attempts.
- Summaries of recent reported incidents (2025) for awareness.
- Non-violent, constitutional policy suggestions for institutions and state governments to protect vulnerable sections.

The sole objective is to empower individuals with knowledge, promote personal and cultural safety, preserve heritage, and foster mutual respect—all grounded in dharmic values of truth, non-violence, and universal welfare.
